/// Lifecycling
/// -----------
/// A promise with no owner will die immediately. You're responsible to
/// keep a promise alive until it to be concluded to a result.
/// If a promise dies with no result, it will crash the app.
/// If you derive subpromises, super-promise will keep astrong references
/// to them. So they will alive while superpromise alive. But you're still
/// responsible to life of subpromises after superpromise dead.
///
/// Cancellation
/// ------------
/// Promise does not provide cascade cancellation. Cancelling a promise
/// cancels only the promise, and any superpromise won't be cancelled.
/// Anyway, you can find superpromises from `superpromise` property, and 
/// cancel them yourself.
/// Promises always propagate cancellation to all subpromises, and how to
/// process the cancellation is fully up to subpromises. If you really want,
/// you can build a subpromise that treats cancellation as a kind of success.
///
/// Promise vs Task
/// ---------------
/// They're almost equal, but different because task describes the operation
/// itself, so implies its result won't be kept. Promise implies a resulting
/// value, so you can treat this as a fuzzy state.
